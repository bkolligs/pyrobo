The rigid collection class $\cal{T}$ is simply a set of transforms, ${\cal T} = \{T_1, T_2, T_3, \dots T_n\}$.
It is required that this list of transforms be expressed in the same datum frame, that is:
\begin{equation}
	{\cal T}^i = \{T_1^i, T_2^i, T_3^i, \dots, T_n^i\}
\end{equation}
The rigid collection is able to be graphed in its "parent" frame $i$, which allows all contained transforms to be visualized. 
The collection is able to add transforms to itself by simply appending new transforms to the set.
