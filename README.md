Robotics Prototyping Package
==========

This is a package that holds classes for rapid robotics development.
It is the bee's knees for the following reasons:
- The power of ROS without needing to write boilerplate code. 
- Uses common libraries like matplotlib and numpy as the basis
- Accelerated by numpy vectorization where applicable 
- Accelerated by C/C++ where applicable
- Written by a roboticist who needed each of these classes at some point for assorted projects, so there is (usually) purpose for each class 

Installation
==========
Until I can put this onto PyPI, feel free to install it into a local python environment like so:
```
git clone https://github.com/bkolligs/robotics-prototyping.git
pip install -e robotics-prototyping
```
