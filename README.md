Robotics Prototyping Package
==========

This is a package that holds classes for rapid robotics development.
It is the bee's knees for the following reasons:
- The power of ROS without needing to write boilerplate code. 
- Uses common libraries like matplotlib and numpy as the basis
- Accelerated by numpy vectorization where applicable 
- Accelerated by C/C++ where applicable
- Written by a roboticist who needed each of these classes at some point for assorted projects, so there is (usually) purpose for each class
